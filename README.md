# cricket_simulator
This is a project based on creating a simulator for the game of cricket.

First of all, you must have a basic knowledge of the game of cricket. You should know various types of fielding strategies, balling techniques, and batting shots.

Currently, I'm developing the logic that will go behind the creation of the simulator. You are free to contribute in any way possible.
